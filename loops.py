# # PRACTICE PROGRAM IN BOTH FOR LOOP AND WHILE LOOP:
# # (19). print number from 1 to 100
# i = 1
# while i <= 100:
#     print(i)
#     i +=1


# # (20). print numbers from 100 to 1
# i = 100
# while i >= 1:
#     print(i)
#     i -= 1


# # (21). print the multiplication table of a number n
# n = int(input("enter the number:")) # user input [ the input which is given is the fixed input and there is no change in that input]
# i = 1       #starting point from where the loop will start and it can be changed
# while i <= 10:  #ending point where the loop will end and it can be changed too
#     print(n*i)  # 'n' is given input and 'i' is the variable which is changing every time
#     i += 1
# # so, basically we shouldn't assign the 'n' value in the loop because it is a fixed value and 'i' is the variable which is changing every time the loop takes place.


# # (22). print the elements of a list using while loop

# index = 0   # index always starts from 0
# while index < len (list):  # len(list) = 10
#     print(list[index])   # prints the element at the current index

#     idx += 1
# # to find the index of the given number we have to create a new variable 'idx' and assign it by 0 and every time it should be increased by 1 till it matches the x value


# # (26). print numbers from 100 to 1 using for loop
# for i in range(100,0,-1):   #in 'step' section if we want to increase the value we have to give positive value and if we want to decrease the value we have to give negative value

# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(n*i)
#     print(f"{n} * {i} = {n*i}") #this line is the formatted string literal which is used to print the multiplication table in a proper format.


# # (29). write a program to find the sum of first n natural numbers using both for loop and while loop
# n = int(input("enter the value of n:")) #here 'n' is taken as 'i'
# sum = 0 #starting/initial value of sum
# for i in range(1,n+1):  #loop starts from (1 to n+1) because the range function exclude the last value
#     sum += i
#     print(sum)
# # finding natural numbers using while loop
